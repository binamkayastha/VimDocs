# VimDocs [Abandoned]

A google docs addon which is supposed to incorporate vim keybindings.

This project is currently a work in progress, and to be quite frank, I don't even know if it's possible. Mostly because from what I currently understand, google docs addon doesn't allow to get keypresses from the main document. However worst case senario, the document would have to be edited through the sidebar, but it should be work getting the vim command mode.

Found out it is next to impossible to do what I was trying to do
